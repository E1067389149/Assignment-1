<h1>My Profile</h1>
<h1>Personal Information</h1>
Name: Jiyuan Wu
Student Number: 3861895
Student Email Address: s3861895@student.rmit.edu.au
<p>My name is Jiyuan Wu, I come from China. And I am studying in RMIT as a student whose major is IT. My friends here get used to call me Bruce, which is my English name. I like listening to music, playing games and watching movies to relax myself. I also some favorite sports like basketball and biking. I have kept many kinds of animals for pet, like birds, fish, turtles, etc. I wanted to keep a dog or a cat as my pet in the past, but the situation did not allow me to do so. Maybe I will have a dog someday in the future. I would like to call myself a gamer, games took a great part in my life in the past few years. I had played some games on computer, but mostly on the phone. I think these experiences of playing games may help me develop my own game in some way. (If I am considering building a game)</p>


<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>The thing that makes me feel most interested in IT is that I will have the ability to design or participate in the design of apps or games after I have completed the whole IT courses in the future. I have been using all kinds of apps and playing so many kinds of games through smart phones or computers through my whole life. Honestly, I am really a great fan of the games, I have played over a hundred different kinds of games already. And I was always wondering that how did those people build such a fantasy game, and I was just curious about that. And that is when my IT dream started. I knew that all the games and the apps are developed by the programmers, so I choose IT as my major in the university because I want to experience building those apps by myself. The experience of being a builder of the apps will be quite different from the experience as a user, that is the thing makes me excited mostly.</p>
<p>The reason of choosing RMIT to be the place to study IT is because it is a school that has good reputation in IT teaching and it is just suitable for me in the location.</p>
<p>Due to my purpose of learning IT, I hope I can learn a lot of skills about how to build an app or a game. Other than that, I hope I can learn some information about AI technology because that is another field that I am interested in.</p>

<h1>Ideal Job</h1> 
Job advertisement url: IT Systems Administrator Job in Brisbane - SEEK
 
<p>This is an advertisement for seeking a IT system administrator. As a student majors in IT, I will be able to deal with many kinds of problems in this field. And this job as an IT administrator is quite relevant to my major, and that is why I choose this job. As their administrator, the company requires the administrator to have the ability to fix hardware and software problems, some other abilities like network routing, switching and firewall management are also required. Furthermore, the company also requires a minimum 5 yearsâ€™ experience in IT and experience within Defence or complex engineering project environments. As a fact, none of these abilities I have got already. So there is still a long way for me to go in the future several years. I need to learn more information about software and hardware, and of course programming is going to be a very base skill for me to learn first. Then I can learn something about internet security and server running, some practice will also be needed.</p>
  
<h1>Personal Profile</h1>

The results of an online learning style test. ( I am a Visual-ISTP learner | Language Learning Style Quiz | Live Lingua)
 
Big Five Personality Test Results (Big Five Personality Test Results (openpsychometrics.org))
 
<p>There are some results of the tests that I just did. The results of the tests are very important information for me, because they can not only tell me the personalities I have and my learning style preference, but can also teach me how to change my behaviors to make things easier for me in the future, especially in some situation when I need to cooperate with others. Due to these results, I am more introverted, and I think a lot. When I were in a team, I can try to be more outgoing so that I can interact with my teammates more and share my thoughts with them. According to these results, I appeal to be more focused on the tasks and sometimes may be lack of communication. So that when I am looking for teammates, I may consider about someone who is more extraverted and has more ideas.</p>
<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<p>For the project, I guess I have got an idea which is not so bad. I am thinking about developing a mobile phone app that can show 3D view of the houses to make things easier between house sellers and buyers.</p>
<p>For the motivation of this project, I just noticed that when people are trying to buy houses, there will be a House 2D floor plan for them to reference. Most of the time, a 2D floor plan is not good enough for the buyers to know about some more detailed information of the house. The normal way to solve this problem is that buyers always take a physical look of the house. The most complicated thing is not physically viewing the house, but for the seller and buyer to reach an agreement and schedule the time for the appointment. To solve this problem, having an app like this will make things much easier for the buyers and the sellers. Considered about the cost of production, this app will be more suitable for Duplex apartment buildings.</p>
<p>Also, I have some ideas about what this app is going to be like. To show more details of the house, the virtual house in this app will not just show a 3D model of the house appearance. It will show how the houses are looked like from both outside and inside. From outside, it shows the 3D exterior of the house and allows users to view from different sides. Also, some information like the House area will also be showed aside. From an internal perspective, it will be like a 3D virtual tour, which shows the structure of the house and allow people to move around every room to see the details. What is more, there are going to be two different identities for two different kinds of users, which are sellers and buyers. Sellers need to contact the developer for a physical look of the houses and then the developer is going to build the model of the houses. As a buyer, users can simply use their phone to have a look at those houses that are showed on this app. They can have a virtual tour of the house rather than have a physically look themselves. Of course, important information of the houses like address, area and floor will also be showed on this app.</p>
<p>I may need to use Unity to fit this project. The main task for the developer is to build 3D model of the houses, for which Unity seems to be a good software to meet the requirements. Other than that, the developer just needs a computer to do the task.</p>
<p>To make this project come true, some skills are required for the developer. High programing and 3D modeling skills are highly required. It is even better for the developer to have experienced doing something like this before, and familiar enough with 3D modeling tools like Unity.</p>
<p>Once the project is completed and with enough number of registered sellers, it will be much more convenient for the house buyers to preview the houses and compare different houses. And for the sellers, it is also a good way to promote their products. </p>
